                    <h3>One of humanity's greatest challenges in preparing for extended missions beyond Earth is figuring out how to cultivate food in space. 
                        Understanding which plants thrive in low-gravity or zero-gravity environments and how they do so is a critical need for future space 
                        operations. As such, it has become necessary to create an environment here on Earth where it is possible to simulate a low-gravity or 
                        zero-gravity environment while still controlling the amount of water and light that the plant recieves.</h3>
                    <h3><a href="https://fairchildgarden.org/science-and-education/science/gbe/">Fairchild's Growing Beyond Earth</a> science program seeks to address this issue through the creation of a three-dimensional clinostat. This 
                        device will rotate in random motion along three axes, which will enable controlled experiments that mimic the low/zero-gravity environment 
                        that space provides. This will allow researchers to study which plants are suitable for such an environment and how certain plants adapt to 
                        growing in such an environment. The data gathered from this project will directly support NASAâ€™s Artemis project, which aims at leading 
                        humanity forward in establishing permanent bases on the moon to facilitate human missions to Mars and aid in researching the rest of space.</h3>

                    <h3>Our client provided us with a RFP, detailing that the end goal of the project was to build a clinostat with working water supply. Our first 
                        step was to create a smaller, working prototype of the clinostat so that we could analyze how it works and figure out the best way to add a 
                        working method of getting water to the plant in the middle of the clinostat.</h3>

                    <h3>In response to a Quora question, career CAD user Irne Barnard describes jumping from one CAD program to another as "It can differ a great 
                    deal or it could be an exact same clone." The top 3 most used CAD programs, AutoCAD, SOLIDWORKS, and Autodesk Inventor, are all over 20 
                    years old, all receiving frequent updates over time. However, when I asked 5 participants of the FRONTIERS summer program I attended at WPI 
                    if they have heard of any of newer CAD programs like OnShape, most said it was not easy to get used to them. They said they would prefer 
                    sticking to the CAD programs they know, even in a team assignment where OnShape would have been far superior.</h3>

                <div class="textbox">
                    <h3>Computer Aided Design software like Fusion360, OnShape, and Solidworks, although having similar primary features in 3D design and modeling, 
                        have UI differences that discourage CAD users from using unfamiliar software. This unfamiliarity can lead to users not using some programs 
                        in use cases they excel in. Fusion 360 offers shape optimization to reduce part weight and material used, OnShape allows for easy sharing 
                        and collaboration features, and SOLIDWORKS houses various industry applicable tools, like flow simulation. While most common CAD programs 
                        have unique, case specific tools that may lead to their use over another program, each also has UI and tools that completely differ from 
                        those of other programs.</h3>
