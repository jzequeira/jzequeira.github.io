                    <h3>I worked on creating a cardboard prototype of the small clinostat to find 
                        the scale needed to fit our smaller panels inside. We decided to scrap this 
                        cardboard design later after finding a scalable model online in day 3. Prior to this 
                        point, our team was working on testing out power systems for the LED and 
                        getting motors to work on the arduino.</h3>

                        second half of class, we ran into the problem of the motor wires tangling 
                        without a designated stop location in the code. I researched how other 
                        rotating applications solved this problem, and informed my group about 
                        using a slip ring.</h3>

                        online to fit our panels. We decided to not resize it for the first print 
                        to have a working prototype for our project mentor meeting next class. I 
                        was able to prepare, start, and finish printing in the same day, and we had 
                        a working prototype with small slip rings over the weekend.</h3>

                        Mario Cruz, in a zoom meeting during class. There, we demonstrated our ideas 
                        going further and what we would do during and after Thanksgiving Break. After 
                        the meeting, I began sketching out the dimensions of the second prototype in 
                        OnShape.</h3>

                        compatible prototype. After some testing and code adjustment, I began to 
                        rescale the initial prototype to fit the second prototype's panel testing 
                        requirement.</h3>

                        the plant casing to give the group a sense of how big the second prototype 
                        will have to be and planned out the translucent plates that will attach the

                        upscaled second prototype to allow for panel testing. We are planning on using 
                        the 20x20x975 mm aluminum extrusions in Belen's Innovation Center with 3D 
                        printed joints to create that secondary prototype.</h3>
