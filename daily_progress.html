                <h2 class="subheader">Day 32 - 3/8 - Fairchild Visit #1</h2>
                <div class="textbox">
                    <h3>We visited Farchild Tropical Botanical Garden for the first time and were 
                        stunned by its plants and maker space in a small corner of a misted forest. We 
                        met up with Mr. Cruz there and we were finally able to meet our other 
                        fairchild mentor, Dr. Lewis. While we were there, we were briefed on updates 
                        for project specifications, including the new light panel we would be using. 
                        The area that the LED's cover is the same, but the panel is slightly wider, 
                        making it slightly too large for what we had as our inner frame at the moment. 
                        I decided we would have to use the flexibility of our design by turning what 
                        we had as our outer frame into our new inner frame. We would have to make a 
                        new outer frame later, as we did not have the parts on hand at Fairchild to 
                        work on it. This change would increase the size of our final prototype, 
                        something we were initially dreading but eventually paying off due to the size 
                        of the plants we would now be using. Since we were not able to work on the 
                        frame today, we got to work on other things, De Toro focusing on his motor and 
                        Cruz-Cruz and Jack updating Mr. Cruz on the progress. I started brainstorming 
                        what we could make to mount the LED panels and plant holder, which we now saw 
                        was a silver bag filled with Vericulite and Perlite - two minerals used as 
                        substitutes for soil for weight purposes. I modeled a T shaped joint using the 
                        model of the L joint I made for the frames and sent it to print to hopefully 
                        be a fix for all those problems. I sent it to print and got to researching how 
                        to connect the frames to each other through the motors. I thought about the 
                        potential bending forces that could be put on the motor due to the torque from 
                        the weight from the things it is holding up, so I went to an idea I saw in a 
                        MIT maker portfolio submission of ofsetting torwue using a rotary guide - a 
                        joint similar to that of a human that keeps the frames attached to each other 
                        and allows the motor to only apply force through pushing on the edges of the 
                        guide, freeing the connection between the frames through the motor. By the 
                        end of the meeting, De Toro got the motors fully working after days of 
                        cracking down on it, and I finished printing out the first experimental 
                        T-joint, which came out bent because I printed it on its side without 
                        sufficient supports. Overall, this was a pivotal day for progress in the 
                        project, and we left with many takeaways and a plan for the future.</h3>

                    <h3>I spent today fixing up the design of the T-joint I designed at Fairchild. I 
                        had to print the other version of the T-joint on its side because the printer 
                        would cause the longer channel to sag and print fail if I printed it on the 
                        face without a channel. I designed a version that would be more printer 
                        friendly, with the longer channel being cut in half so there would be no 
                        overhang from the printer and so supports can reach inside. In this version, 
                        the longer channel supported itself only through one face of the extrusion 
                        because of the indent the extrusions have in the middle. It was supported by 
                        grip on the outer edges to not break off and increase print stability. This 
                        fix helped in the long run, as I used this half channel later to attach the 
                        motors and slip rings to the frames.</h3>
