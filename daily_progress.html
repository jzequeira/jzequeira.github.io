                        the scale needed to fit our smaller panels inside. We decided to scrap this 
                        cardboard design later after finding a scalable model online in day 3. Prior 
                        to this point, our team was working on testing out power systems for the LED
                         and

                        second half of class, we ran into the problem of the motor wires tangling 
                        without a designated stop location in the code. I researched how other 
                        rotating applications solved this problem, and informed my group about 
                        using a slip ring.</h3>

                        to have a working prototype for our project mentor meeting next class. I 
                        was able to prepare, start, and finish printing in the same day, and we had 
                        a working prototype with small slip rings over the weekend.</h3>

                        the meeting, I began sketching out the dimensions of the second prototype in

                        rescale the initial prototype to fit the second prototype's panel testing

                    <h3>I started brainstorming my non-subtractive 3D print, and chose to work on a 
                        simpler inner gear system before working on a rotary motor after looking into 
                        them. After deciding, I worked on making an L-joint for the new clinostat 
                        prototype. For maximum structural stability for its heavy load, I decided to 
                        make a notch to fit all sides of the extrusion. I also reasoned that this 
                        would allow us to attach the joints firmly without using screws or damaging 
                        the joints.</h3>

                        best possible fit. I then printed out the first version of the L-joint, which 
                        ended up being too loose, allowing some wiggle room for the extrusion. I 
                        tightened the tolerances in the L-joint ends and left it to print for next 
                        class.</h3>

                    <h3>After picking up the L-joint version 2, I tested it and saw that the inside 
                        edges were perfect but the outside ones were still too loose. Additionally, I 
                        realized that a friction fit would not be strong enough to hold the plant and 
                        testing equipment inside the clinostat, so I added a screw hole at the top 
                        edges and included chamfers on all sides.</h3>

                    <h3>I tested the newest L-joint with the screw hole and chamfer, and it ended up 
                        fitting perfectly. I decided that a screw for increased friction again was not 
                        enough, so I drilled holes into our aluminum extrusions to allow the screws to 
                        go through and prepared for cutting next class.</h3>
