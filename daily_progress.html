                    <h3>I worked on creating a cardboard prototype of the small clinostat to find 
                        the scale needed to fit our smaller panels inside. We decided to scrap this 
                        cardboard design later after finding a scalable model online in day 3. Prior to this 
                        point, our team was working on testing out power systems for the LED and 
                        getting motors to work on the arduino.</h3>

                        second half of class, we ran into the problem of the motor wires tangling 
                        without a designated stop location in the code. I researched how other 
                        rotating applications solved this problem, and informed my group about 
                        using a slip ring.</h3>

                        online to fit our panels. We decided to not resize it for the first print 
                        to have a working prototype for our project mentor meeting next class. I 
                        was able to prepare, start, and finish printing in the same day, and we had 
                        a working prototype with small slip rings over the weekend.</h3>

                        Mario Cruz, in a zoom meeting during class. There, we demonstrated our ideas 
                        going further and what we would do during and after Thanksgiving Break. After 
                        the meeting, I began sketching out the dimensions of the second prototype in 
                        OnShape.</h3>

                        compatible prototype. After some testing and code adjustment, I began to 
                        rescale the initial prototype to fit the second prototype's panel testing 
                        requirement.</h3>

                        Later on in the day, I finished my 2D CAD designed logo, uploaded it to my 
                        website, and made a vinyl sticker out of it with the school's Cricut.</h3>
