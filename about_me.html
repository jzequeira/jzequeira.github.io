                    <p>I'm Jose Zequeira, a current senior at Belen Jesuit Prep School in Miami, Florida with a strong passion for making. This passion has been propelled over the years by my interests in both robotics and software engineering and design, leading me to build skills in CAD and coding languages like Javascript, Java, and Python. My calling to creation and collaboration has pushed me to lead the schoolâ€™s FIRST Tech and FIRST Robotics Challenge teams, in which I have fostered a community of like minded individuals to bring creative ideas into reality.</p>
