                <h3>Computer Aided Design software like Fusion360, OnShape, and Solidworks, although having similar primary features in 3D design and modeling, 
                    have UI differences that discourage CAD users from using unfamiliar software. This unfamiliarity can lead to users not using some programs 
                    in use cases they excel in. Fusion 360 offers shape optimization to reduce part weight and material used, OnShape allows for easy sharing 
                    and collaboration features, and SOLIDWORKS houses various industry applicable tools, like flow simulation. While most common CAD programs 
                    have unique, case specific tools that may lead to their use over another program, each also has UI and tools that completely differ from 
                    those of other programs.</h3>
