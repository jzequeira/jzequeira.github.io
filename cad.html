                    <h3>I was tasked with creating a logo for our project's makeshift company in this assignment. Since most students did not have access to the school 
                        computers outside of class time, many, including me, took Mr. Perez's advice in downloading Affinity Design, a 2D CAD program available on both iPads 
                        and computers. I started to sketch out and brainstorm the design on Notability, an iPad app, and gave the three candedates to others for feedback, from 
                        which I decided to do the second.</h3>

                    <h3>In Affinity, I decided to create multiple designs for the top half of the planet to see which one would look better.</h3>

                    <h3>I created these shapes by making two identical circles, offsetting one slightly in the Y-direction, and pressing the subtract option in the menu.</h3>

                    <h3>I created the second ellipse by making a donut shape from the shapes tool, flattening it, and shortening the arc by pulling on a red dot on its surface. 
                        When I got the right width, I lined them both up, selected both, pressed the menu button, and selected convert to curves. When I was done, I closed off 
                        the ends of the donut ellipse and grouped the two shapes so they could act similar to how one shape would.</h3>

                    <h3>After a lot of testing and YouTube tutorials, I had the planet part of the logo ready. For the tree part, I used the pen tool to tap out straight lines 
                        and drag out curved ones to resemble a trunk the planet would attach to.</h3>

                    <h3>All that was left to do for the logo was to color the trunk and planet, group them, and duplicate them to another sketch. There, the logo would be 
                        exported as an SVG file, or a vector file, so it would not lose quality after compression and decompression. </h3>

                    <h3>Now, we were tasked with creating an extremely basic 3D prototype of our final product. I initially wanted to make something simple that was scalable 
                        to fit the lighting panels. For this project, I used OnShape for its ability to be shared with others easily. I needed this trait because very few 
                        computers in Belen have access to the slicer programs, so, if needed, I could ask my teacher to print it for me by sharing the document with his email.

                        one side with extrude offsets to create the inner, gray tube.</h3>
