                    <h3>In class, we were taught about the benefit of 3D printing and other additive 
                        manufacturing methods compared to subtractive techniques, like creating a 
                        part with space inside of it or a moving system without the need to manually 
                        assemble it. I decided to utilize the latter in my next minor project with a 
                        print-in-place gear system.</h3>

                    <h3>I went with a gear ratio fidget toy for this project, wanting to work with 
                        gear ratios and learn how to use them along the way. I heard about an easy 
                        way to create gears on OnShape, so I stuck with that software for the time 
                        being. I looked up the spur gear custom feature and looked into the 
                        calculations behind it.</h3>

                    </div>

                    <h3>This feature calculates the gear's module by dividing the pitch diameter 
                        to the number of teeth, designating a certain amount of the pitch circle to 
                        each gear tooth. The pitch circle is the measure of </h3>

                    </div>

                    <h3>After familiarizing myself with gears, I learned this feature supports 
                        helical and herringbone gears on top of spurs and decided to use helical 
                        gears for an extra layer of complexity.</h3>

                    </div>

                    <h3>I started by creating two helical gears and setting the distance between 
                        them to be the sum of the gears' pitch circle radii. In hindsight, I could 
                        have made the two pitch circles coincident, which would have saved a few 
                        clicks, but more importantly saved time if I had to resize the gears. </h3>

                    </div>

                    <h3>I then created the measurements for the base of the toy; the part meant to 
                        be held to spin the gears. I made its axles around 0.5 mm smaller than the 
                        gears' center bores to allow it to move and account for the expansion of 
                        printed items.</h3>

                    </div>

                    <h3>I extruded the gear axes and offset extruded the two faces of the base to 
                        let the user hold the gears while turning them, keeping the same 0.5 mm 
                        spacing between the gear and the bases.</h3>

                    <h3>The last thing to do before printing was to angle the gears. However, the 
                        formula I looked up for angling gears to fit ended up being wrong.</h3>

                    </div>

                    <h3>For time's sake, I ended up realigning them myself, which worked out to 
                        3/160 of the 360 degrees the circle has. I wish to look more into the gear 
                        angle problem later to see where, if at all, I went wrong.</h3>

                    <h3>After that, V1 was ready for printing.</h3>

                    </div>

                    <h3>V1 came out of the printer completely immobile, so I knew I messeed up 
                        somewhere. After breaking the final product and seeing where it went wrong 
                        inside, I saw the gears fused to the axle, the base plates, and each other, 
                        so I knew I had to increase the spacing further.</h3>
                    <div class="image">

                    </div>

                    <h3>After changing the spacing to 1.5 mm and budging the final product a little, 
                        it was able to rotate smoothly without bumps or rubbing, and I was happy 
                        with the final result.</h3>

                    <h3>If I were to rework the current design, I would want to make it easier to 
                        print in place by adding an angle to the gears and slightly increasing the 
                        center bore diameter to stop the supports from interfering with its 
                        rotation. In future designs, I also want to allow the user to use it like 
                        a fidget toy, with their fingers controlling the rotation of the gears by 
                        making the rotation axis stuck to the gears themselves and not the frame. 
                        Although it was simple, this was one of my favorite projects so far. To 
                        continue working with print-in-place motion designs, I would like to work on 
                        modeling and printing a rotary engine from scratch.</h3>

                    <h3>For the second part of this mini-project, we were tasked with learning how 
                        to 3D-scan objects. I used the Scaniverse app on my phone to complete this 
                        project, which uses infrared light through LiDAR (Light Detection And 
                        Ranging) to determine the distance to a specific object. I used Scaniverse 
                        not only for its mobile convenience, but also because it keeps the original 
                        color of the objects, making any final print more aesthetically pleasing.</h3>

                    <h3>As you revolve around the object, the app picks up more distances and 
                        generates a 3D model that fits the points you scanned.</h3>

                    <h3>I decided at first to scan my school water bottle. After taking about four 
                        minutes to generate the model by revolving around the object, the model 
                        came out hollow, with a large gap in the middle of the water bottle.</h3>

                    <h3>The bottle was most likely hollow because of its bumpy, dimpled surface and 
                        the metal's tendency to reflect light, which may cause the LiDAR to get 
                        messed up while generating the model. Although the bottle didn't survive 
                        the process, the background looked extremely accurate, leaving some hope 
                        for future tests.</h3>

                    <h3>Next, I decided to scan something else to have a complete 3D model of 
                        something familiar to me, for which I chose to scan my brother's drum set. 
                        On this scan, there were also a few holes at the center of the drums, which 
                        draws some questions as to the accuracy of the app, but just may be another 
                        special case like the bottle.</h3>

                        This part of the model at least is fully printable and applicable in 
                        other use cases.</h3>
