                    <h3>The aim of this project was to familiarize ourselves with the theory, design software, and production of circuits. We used KiCad on our school 
                        computers to create the PCB's as a free alternative to other industry standard circuit designers. </h3>

                    <h3>After the download finished, I opened KiCad and began to familiarize myself with the software. While I liked the compartmentalization in its opening 
                        a new window for each part, it ended up being pretty cluttered by the end. For the first half of this project, we were tasked with creating a simple 
                        circuit that would power an LED with a battery.</h3>

                    <h3>I then looked up which parts we would be using for our future circuits and assigned them to the part footprints in the footprint editor. This took a 
                        while due to the amount of footprints we had to go through to find the right one, so I wrote them down in case for future projects.</h3>

                    <h3>Finally, I put the circuit together in the PCB editor, connecting wire between the three parts and orienting them as desired. This part was where I 
                        struggled most in terms of navigating menus, showing in the 5 minutes it took me to find out how to add wiring. However, in the end, I had a completed 
                        circuit, having gained expereince with circuit design software UI for later use.</h3>

                        time any of us used buttons in making electronics, we were taught how they worked before starting. We created a new project and got to work on a new 
                        schematic, attaching two buttons before their respective resistor and LED.</h3>

                    <h3>Unfortunately, the 3D view was not enough to stop our impatience, and when we finally cut our circuit, we saw that the bottom side of the button lined 
                        up with the other half of the wire, allowing current to pass through it without the button being pressed. There was also a much less controllable issue 
                        with the school CNC machine, since it cut the circuit much more than it should be at its borders, rendering this version unusable.</h3>

                    <h3>We later fixed the issue with the button on the bottom by pushing the button up and replacing the wire in KiCad, having a functional final circuit for 
                        whenever we would need it.</h3>
